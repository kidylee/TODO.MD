# TODO.md
TODO.md is a file which can create by your own and add into your project. As the way that CHANGELOG.md managing release level, TODO.md helps solo developer on daily works. With command line and extensions' help, it even can generate  git comment message base on what have you done. 

## Why another todo tool
Well, a lot todo tools have been made for other people life easier, but we forget developer ourselives. As a solo developer, we also need to manage memos, todo lists, issue tracker and release notes, but that not means we need a very fat management tool to track them. Instead, a todo file, which lives in our project and works well with Git, is enough for us.
